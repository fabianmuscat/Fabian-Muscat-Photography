              <h1>Camera</h1>
              <p>The Canon EOS 1300D is a Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) Camera. It has an APS-C sized sensor and also includes Wi-Fi and NFC for image transffering. The size of this camera
              is relatively small since it is an entry-level camera and is well textured, which helps it to sit nicely in your hand. A mode dial can be found on the top of the camera, which lets
              you change between different exposure modes quickly. A few buttons can be found on the rear of the camera to change settings easily. There are also some direct keys for some settings,
              such as ISO, AF Type and white balance.</p>

              <h1>Tripod</h1>
              <p>This is the Hama Star 63 Tripod. This tripod has a height of 166cm and is made of aluminium. Its minimum height is 66cm and the max load is 4000g. This tripod is suitable for
              camcorders and DSLRs. It is made up of 3 sections and comes with a 3-way tilt head and handle. A spirit level is also included for making sure that landscape shots are are level
              with the horizon. This tripod features a hook for adding additional weight as well as a fully adjustable centre column.</p>

              <h1>Lenses</h1>
              <h2 style="font-family: 'Righteous', cursive; font-weight: lighter;">Canon 50mm Prime Lens - <span style="font-style: italic;">"Fifty Nifty Lens"</span></h2>
              <p>Fifty mm lenses are used frequently in many photography applications, such as fashion, portraiture, weddings, documentary, lifestyle, sports and many more. When the 50mm lens
              is mounted on an APS-C/1.6x Field of View Crop Factorial (FOVCF) body, an angle of view equivalent to an 80mm lens on a full frame body is delivered. This focal length can be used for
              panorama images. A feature that prime lenses have, is an ultra-wide aperture, meaning that more light can pass through the camera to reach the imaging sensor. The depth of field is also
              reduced due to this wide aperture, meaning that a stronger background blur can be created. As the aperture narrows beyond f/8, the depth of field is increased, however the cange is not noticeable.
              <br><br>
              A key reason to buy a prime lens over a zoom lens, is to get a wider aperture, however, if the goal is to get sharp images, using the widest aperture is not the best solution. Taking images at the
              widest aperture offered by the 50mm lens (f/1.8) will end up blurring the image more than sharpening it. Images would need extra contrast/de-haze and sharpening. With an aperture of f/2, the center
              of the frame shows some improvement in sharpness. At f/2.8, the center is very sharp, whereas the mid-frame of the image circle is sharp, yet remain rather soft. As the aperture narrows, the
              quality of the image and sharpness continue improving. The sharpest images are produced with an aperture of betwenn f/8 and f/11. Diffreaction becomes noticeable when the aperture is at its narrowest, that is f/22.
              However, this is already noticeable at f/16. The AF system of this lens uses a stepping motor as shown in its name, Canon EF 50 f/1.8 <strong>STM</strong>. When the lens is set at AF, the focusing ring does not turn
              and FTM (Full Time Manual) is also supported. When set at Manual Focus (MF), the focusing ring can be turned and to see fine adjustments, turn the ring slowly. To see faster changes, turn the ring quickly.

              <h2 style="font-family: 'Righteous', cursive; font-weight: lighter;">Rokinon 10mm Wide Angle Lens</h2>
              <p>The Rokinon 10mm f2.8 lens is a super wide angle lens, which is mainly used for architectural and landscape photography. This lens is relatively small and lightweight, making it comfortable to carry when walking.
              It also has a focus ring towards the front and an aperture ring near the mount. Right between these two rings can be found a depth of field scale. Unlike previous Rokinon lenses, this lense's build quality is of higher quality
              and is strong, even though it has a plastic feel. Only one option is available for focusing with this lens, that is manual focus. Focusing is smooth and when used with the DOF scale, it can make improve the shooting experience.
              However, focusing may be tough for those who aren't used to using manual focus as no auto focus is available with this lens.
              <br><br>
              The image quality of Rokinon lenses is excellent, and the image quality of this lens is no less than the other's. For an affordable price, this lens is quite sharp, but the only downside to this would be that the photographer would need
              to manually focus it and will not always come out as sharp. Sharpness isn't the best in this lens, however, when the aperture is stopped down to f/5.6 - f/8, its performance is great. As said in the beginning, the best use of this
              lens would be for architecture and landscape photography. To get the best out of this lens, a tripod would be recommended using with a low ISO. The bokeh created by this lens is something that can be created by Google Cam's Lens blur
              due to its focal length. Color fringing with this lens is not noticeable, which is really good considering its price.
