              <strong>box-shadow:</strong> This was used in the "Equipement and Info" and "Gallery" Webpages to make a box shadow behind the images in both webpages.

              <strong>justify-content:</strong> This property was used in every page when the website is being viewed on a viewport less than a desktop to center the content.
                It was also used for seperate content in the "Contact" and "Gallery" webpages. In the Contact, the form was centered when viewed on a smartphone
                and the images were centered as well in the Gallery webpage when viewed on a smartphone. For this property to work, the "display: flex" property was implemented before.
                <br><br>
              <strong>opacity:</strong> This property was used in the navigation bar and in the contact form to reduce the opacity when hovering over the buttons/icons.
              <br><br>
              <strong>grid-gap:</strong> This was used in the "Gallery" and "Equiment and Info" webpages to set the column/row gaps simultaneously of the grid. The "display: grid" property was used before.
              <br><br>
              <strong>grid-template-columns:</strong> This was used in the "Gallery" and "Equiment and Info" webpages to set the number of columns required.
              <br><br>
              <strong>grid-row:</strong> Ths was used in the "Gallery" webpage to set the height of the row of certain images as they were larger than others. They were spaned over 2 rows.
              <br><br>
              <strong>background-size:</strong> This property was used to set the background size of images that were imported using the "background-image: url()" property. This was used in the navigation bar and the
                "Equiment and Info" webpage.<br><br>
              <strong>border-radius:</strong> This property was used in the contact form to set the radius of the form and in the "Equipment and Info" page to set the radius of an image.
